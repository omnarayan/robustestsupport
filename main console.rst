Roughly speaking, the main RITE console is composed of three parts. From top to bottom, they are menu bar, script editor, and status bar. The menu bar includes (from left to right):
 - Add button: Clears the script editor and makes it ready to record a new script under the current project.
 - Load button: Toggles the script `loading/saving`_  area.
 - Project button: Opens the `project details dialog`_ which handles tasks like importing/exporting a project and deleting scripts from project.
 - Play button: Shows the `playback`_ runtime dialog for playing back the current script(s).
 - Record button: Starts `recording`_ in the tab under record.
 - Custom JS button: Shows the dialog where users could write `custom Javascript functions`_.
 - Settings button: Shows the `settings dialog`_.
 - Content Map button: Shows the `content map area`_.
 - Refresh button: Refreshes the console, note that this will lose all the current recorded but not saved script and any RITE status.
