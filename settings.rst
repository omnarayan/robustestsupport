In the Settings dialog, there are several options you could config:

* Playback Interval: The interval between two consecutive time ticks during playback.
* Default timeout: The default timeout value when a step takes too long during playback. The default value is 40 secs.
* Take Screenshot: In case you wouldn't want to include any screenshots during recording, you could check this option off.
* Use Xpath: By default, RITE uses `descriptor`_ to locate elements. Once check this option, it'll locate the elements by xpath, also it opens the `Xpath finder`_ by default in recording mode to help with finding the right xpath.
